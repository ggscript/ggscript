##Starting the App
- [ ] Clone this repo as well as the [GGShell](https://github.com/ggscript/ggshell) repository

- [ ] Run `npm install` within your terminal to download the depndencies for both repos.

- [ ] If this is the first time you are starting GGScript you need to navigate to the `config` file and add your Postgres credentials to the `databaste.credentials.example.js` file and rename it to `databaste.credentials.example.js`.  Repeat the same steps for `auth.example.js` with the Google Auth credentials you can get from Google Developer Console.

- [ ] Within the GGScript repo run `node db/seed.js` to seed your Postgres database and create your initial tables.

- [ ] Within your terminal run `node server/server.js` on both repos.

- [ ] You can now access GGScript from `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
